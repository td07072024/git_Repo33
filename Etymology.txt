The current name for Bethlehem in local languages is Bayt Laḥmⓘ /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning "house of meat", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally "house of bread" or "house of food."[9][10] The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem.[11] Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.[12]
