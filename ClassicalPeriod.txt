The Gospel of Matthew Matthew 1:18–2:23[35] and the Gospel of Luke Luke 2:1–39[36] represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem,[32][33][34] known at the time as בית לחמא (Beit Lachma) in Aramaic, meaning "House of Bread". Modern scholars, however, regard the two accounts as contradictory[33][34] and the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth.[34] Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth,[37][38][39] while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.[40]

Nonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church.[32] In around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born.[32] The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius.[32] After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.[41][42]

In around 395 CE, the Church Father Jerome wrote in a letter: "Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented."[43] Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz.[43][44] Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz[43] and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem.[43] Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz[43] and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death.[43] Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.[43]

In 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem.[6][32] The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born.[32] During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I.[6][32] In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem.[45] A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.
