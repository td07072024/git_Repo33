Canaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean "house of", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to.[13][14] Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu,[15] lahmo being the Chaldean word for "fertility".[11][14] Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder [de], was "certainly accurate".[a] Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: "'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic."[16] While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted,[9] it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.[17]
